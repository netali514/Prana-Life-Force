# Prana-Life-Force
Call for code Global Challenge 2021 - Team Data Warrirors

## Short description

### What's the problem?

Predict level of CO2 for better and healthier environment.

### How can technology help?

NGOs and Government can use this predictive tool to check levels of CO2 per capita and based on this take necessary actions to reduce the impact and make a world healthier and safer place to live in.

### The idea

Predict Co2 emission per capita considering different reasons like deforestation, co2 emission from different sources, etc. Propose a solution as which factor should be reduced and measures to be taken to control Co2 levels.

## The architecture

![Video transcription/translation app](https://github.com/netali514/Prana-Life-Force/blob/main/Architecture.PNG)

1. The user navigates to the site and uploads a video file.
2. Watson Speech to Text processes the audio and extracts the text.
3. Watson Translation (optionally) can translate the text to the desired language.
4. The app stores the translated text as a document within Object Storage.
