# Problem Statement -

Covid-19 has reminded us of importance of Oxygen in the air we breathe. Factors such as industrialization, population explosion, vehicle emissions, deforestation, constructions adversely impact all the ecosystems. 
If these factors are not controlled soon, we will have to face severe health issues and deterioration of the quality of life. Taking no action will end up costing us a lot more than if we act now. Co2 is an important contributor for air pollution and changing climatic condition. Our solution, Prana, gives data driven prediction of Co2 level for a selected geographical area and percentage significance of each contributing factor. Armed with this information, we can then funnel our focus on controlling those significant factors to achieve better air quality by controlling Co2 levels for short term and consider other factors to achieve sustainable environment in the long run.

## Is Co2 that very harmful?

The problem isn’t carbon dioxide itself, it’s the sheer levels of CO2 that we produce in today’s world. Ever since the Industrial Revolution, CO2 levels in the atmosphere have been increasing drastically. Deforestation and the burning of fossil fuel have contributed to extraordinarily high levels of CO2 emissions.

It’s not as though the atmosphere is overloaded with carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide only accounts for less than 1% of atmospheric gases. But the world has a delicate carbon balance, and we are throwing off that balance every day.

1.	GHG effect - Carbon dioxide’s role in the greenhouse effect is a major contributor to air pollution. Radiation and heat emanating from the earth’s surface need to be released out into the atmosphere. But because carbon dioxide levels are so high, there is an ozone effect on the ground level. This means that the heat is trapped against the earth’s surface and the earth cannot cool at night. This also means that oceans cannot cool off, and the water is warmer. Well, the oceans absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. This is a huge step in the carbon cycle. As the temperature of the waters increase, the oceans cannot absorb carbon dioxide as well. So the problem compounds: more carbon dioxide means the ocean can’t clean it out as efficiently, and this means there is more carbon dioxide stuck in the air. The cycle repeats.

2.	Climate Change - As we all have heard, the increase in carbon dioxide is a major contributor to climate change. The earth’s surface temperature has continued to rise over the last century. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has conducted studies confirming this, and they pinpoint excess carbon dioxide as the primary contributing factor. This increase in temperature has compounded the problems we’ve already discussed.

3.	Acid Rain - One little-discussed issue with air pollution is acid rain. As the emissions from fossil fuel burning combine with moisture in the air, precipitation forms that has a high acid content. This is a very serious form of air pollution that damages trees and other plant life. It also pollutes water and soil. And because emissions can travel far, the acid rain can impact environments worldwide - which makes it a very serious form of air pollution.

4.	Personal Health - Increased carbon dioxide displaces oxygen in the atmosphere. So as carbon dioxide levels rise, breathing becomes more difficult. If you are in a closed location and this occurs, you start experiencing greater health problems, like recurring headaches. It also can increase harmful air pollutants that contribute to indoor air pollution.
